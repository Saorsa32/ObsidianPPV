# ‚òØÔ∏è Mental Clarity
## No hurry, no pause
Calmly and confidently moving through tasks yields better results than rushing through the day to end up burnt out. -Tim Ferris

## Acceleration
- Shaping my momentum through perpetual action
    **. "[I]f someone‚Äôs much better than you at something, they probably try much harder. You probably underestimate how much harder they try. I‚Äôm not saying that talent isn‚Äôt a meaningful differentiator, because it certainly is, but I think people generally underestimate how effort needs to be poured into talent in order to develop it. So much of getting good at anything is just pure labor: figuring out how to try and then offering up the hours."**
    
    **‚Äî¬†[Effort](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/xmu2gl72nph6h0282gc5/qvh8h7h8266kp9fl/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdmEuc3Vic3RhY2suY29tL3AvZWZmb3J0)**  

THE question: **What matters now?**
THE *next* question: **Of the things which matter now, what is important that I do vs someone else?**

## Focus
<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è **Your most persistent distractions will seem justified to you.**

</aside>

- **Focus and Intention**

How would the person I want to become spend their time? -Nir Eyal

"The cost of thing is the amount ... life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run." -Henry David Thoreau

## Action-Orientation
- Every action is a vote the type of person you wish to become.
- **Being successful is rarely about your ability to plan - it's about your ability to act.**
    - Be careful about over-planning

- **Curiosity, courage, and persistence are the gatekeepers.**
- **Each day is a new battle to say yes to what matters and say no to what doesn't. Focus is practice.** -James Clear

## The "Do" Manifesto
- Inspired by "Manifesto of a DOer", modified & extended

    **1. Leverage your energy. You can‚Äôt increase the number of hours in a day, but you can multiply your effort.** Understand the power of the influencers: The few influence the many.¬†Find your multiplier. The person, the company, the organisations who can accelerate the change you want to make.
    
    **2. Avoid easy deadlines.** Deadlines serve you best when they are short, hard and, at first glance, impossible. Urgency gets things done.
    
    **3. Follow through. On the big things. On the small things. Create a habit of always following through. As habits go, it‚Äôs a good one to have.**
    
    **4. Focus on the task.** If you are doing something that isn‚Äôt pushing the task forward, that is called distraction. Distractions are plentiful. But remember, distractions stop you from doing.
    
    **5. Obstacles will come your way. Guaranteed**. Think of them as a gift. They will make you stronger. They will make you more creative. Rather than break you, they will define you.
    
    **6. Ideas change things.** But ideas by themselves change nothing. An idea needs effort to make it happen. Do the work.
    
    **7. If you find something that you want to change, you have two options.** One, is to talk about the change you are going to make. Or, two, stop talking. And begin.
    
    **8. What you are doing is hard, but not impossible.** Practice optimism.
    
    **9. What is the priority today?** Ask yourself this every day. It‚Äôs your job to keep the main thing the main thing.
    
    **10. The energy available to get this done is directly proportional to how much it matters to you.** Only commit to things that matter.
    
    **11. Perfection comes over time.** Not at the beginning. Start where you are. But start.
    
    **12. Sprint. Rest. Sprint. Rest. Human‚Äôs get more done in bursts followed by rest.** Getting things done isn‚Äôt about who does the longest hours, but who does the smartest hours.
    
    **13. 80% of your time is spent on things that you are not good at.** 20% of your time is spent on the things you are very good at. In order to get more done, flip that.
    
    **14. Teams multiply change.** Teams with a clear purpose, and a clear sense of the change they can make, get the most done.
    
    - How can purpose be distilled to be ingrained in all members of the team?
    
    **15. Keep your energy for pushing forward.** The past is done. Things out of your control cannot be changed. Energy spent being angry, jealous, or cynical is negative energy. Stay positive.
    
    **16. Make a plan.** Then accept it can and will change. Making something happen is about being nimble and adaptable.
    
    **17. Say no. And say it often.** As David Allen says: ‚ÄúYou can do anything, but not everything.‚Äù Protect your time.
    
    **18. Making things happen is fun. Making things happen that matter with a team as crazy as you are, is the best fun of all.**
    
    **19. Little actions repeated relentlessly result in big change.** Don‚Äôt underestimate the importance of ‚Äòsmall‚Äô multiplied by ‚Äòoften‚Äô.
    
    **20. Make a pact with failure early on. Respect it. But don‚Äôt fear it. If it occupies your mind whilst doing, it can stop you from winning. Free your mind.**
    
    **21. Even though you are busy, make time to help others who are at the start of their journey.** Give back. It will help you.
    
    **22. All teams want to be part of history.** Have something big that you want to change. This is bigger than you. Your purpose multiplies the team‚Äôs stubbornness to get this thing done.
    
    **23. If you are going to make change happen, make it a good one.** This planet needs as many friends as it can get.
    

## Learning

<aside>
üí° "Man," he said, "you are a *learner.* Tell me. How can I be learner?"
"It's simple. To be a learner, you've got to be willing to be a fool."

</aside>

- **Learning**
    
    Thinking critically as often as possible to keep updating understanding, learning. 
    

## Inputs
"Your actions are a consequence of your thoughts.

Your thoughts are a consequence of what you consume.

And in the modern age, what you consume is largely a consequence of how you select and refine your social media feed.

Choose better inputs. Get better outputs." -James Clear

## Effort
> A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time ‚Äî most people don't even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. People have an enormous capacity to make things happen, A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential.

Ask for what you want. You usually won't get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when this works, it works surprisingly well. Almost always, the people who say "I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I'm going to figure them out", and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way." -Sam Altman (Source: How to be Successful)
